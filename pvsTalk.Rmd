# What is the Physical Volume Store?

Our simulation has over 2,000 distinct volumes. These volumes have names. The names can be long...

- `VacuumChamberCadMeshWallPV[06]`
- `SingleStrawPV - 18 ~ 4 ~ 1 ~ 1 ~ 14`

<br><br>

--

We store volumes in various hit and track data products for many purposes...

- In what volume did a Geant track start or stop?
- What volumes does a Geant track intersect?
- What calorimeter crystal did a particle enter?
- What straw was hit?

---

# What's the problem?

Storing these names in the data products as strings would lead to a large disk<sup>1</sup> and memory footprint.  

And these names would likely be repeated many times over in the file. 

.footnote[
[1] Maybe not for disk as Root probably compresses such strings
]

--

<br/><br/>

To reduce size and avoid repitition of large strings, store and ID instead of the string itself. Then store a table of the ID to string mapping. 

--

<br/>

This is the **physical volume store**.

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# The old solution

`gm2 v7_05_00` and earlier

---

# Old solution

The ID is an `int`. The volume name strings are stored in an `std::vector<std::string>`. 
Code requests an ID from,
```c++
artg4::PhysicalVolumeStoreService::idGivenPhysicalVolume
```
<br/>
--

Given the Geant physical volume, the code,

- Gets the volume name
- Looks up the name in the vector (a map helps here)
- If the name exists, then return its index in the vector
- If the name does not exist, `push_back` into the vector and return the new index

--

<br/>
The vector is stored in the **Run record**
---

# Problems with the Old Solution

- The ID number you get for a volume depends on when the calling code asked for it. 

- e.g. First volume gets ID 0, second distinct volume gets 1

--

- A particular volume may (likely) have a different ID number in different files. 

--

- Consequences
  - ID numbers are not "deterministic"
  - Aggregation (merging Physical Volume Tables) is impossible
  - Analysis outside of art is difficult (would need a PVS table for each analyzed file)
  
--

- The lack of aggregation problem is aggregious (see later)

---

# Old solution code (skipping a lot)

```c++
// artg4/pluginActions/util/StringIDs.hh  (partial listing)
namespace artg4 {
    class StringIDs {
    public:
      // ...
      // Given a string, return the ID and add it to the list
      unsigned int idGivenString(const std::string & s);

      // Given an ID, return the string
      const std::string & stringGivenID(unsigned int id) const {
        return stringVec_.at( id );
      }
    
      // Return the number of entries
      unsigned int size() const { return stringVec_.size(); }
    
    private:
      // The vector that holds the strings
      std::vector<std::string> stringVec_;
    
      // Auxillary map
      std::map<std::string, unsigned int> stringToIdMap_;
```

---

```c++
// artg4/util/StringIDs.cc  (partial listing)

// Get the ID for a string. If it is not already in the vector, then add it
unsigned int artg4::StringIDs::idGivenString(const std::string& s) {
  // Do we already have s?
  unsigned int val = 0;
  bool found = false;
  
  // If the string vector is not empty, then we have to look in the map
  if ( ! stringVec_.empty() ) {
    // Look in the map for the ID number
    auto mapIter = stringToIdMap_.find(s);
    if ( mapIter != stringToIdMap_.end() ) {
      // Found it
      val = mapIter->second;
      found = true;
    }
  }
  
  if ( ! found ) {
    // String not found, add it
    val = stringVec_.size();
    stringVec_.push_back( s );
    stringToIdMap_[ s ] = val;
  }
  
  return val;
}

# The new solution

`gm2 v7_06_00` and newer (hopefully)

---

# New solution

- Instead of non-deterministic `int` IDs, use a [hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function). 

- A hash takes an abritrary length thing and determines a fixed length representation of that thing

- Examples: [crc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check) - 32 bits, [md5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) - 128 bits, [sha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithms) - 256 bits

- C++ standard library has `std::hash` that returns a `size_t` of 64 bits. See [reference](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/hash)

- Important not to have a hash collision (two strings resulting in the same hash value). The more bits in your hash, the less chance of collision. 

---

# Hash Collisions

A collision would be a disaster. <br/>

![](http://preshing.com/images/small-probabilities.png)

---

# New solution

Hash size of 64 bits seems sufficient! All stored IDs need to be changed to `size_t`. 

Getting an ID number...

- Get Geant volune name
- Determine hash -> ID
- Look up ID in the `map<size_t, std::string>`
- If ID is found, check that the string in the map is ths same as the volume name. If not, then collision
- If ID is not found, add to the map
- return the ID

---

# New solution code

```c++
// artg4/util/StringIDs.hh  (partial listing)
namespace artg4 {
  class StringIDs {
    public:
      // Given a string, return the ID and add it to the list
      size_t idGivenString(const std::string & s);

      // Given an ID, return the string
      const std::string & stringGivenID(size_t id) const {
        return hashToStringMap_.at( id );
      }

    private:
      // The map that holds the strings
      std::map< size_t, std::string> hashToStringMap_;

      // Don't expose the hash to ROOT
      #ifndef __ROOTCLING__
      std::hash<std::string> hash_fn_;
      #endif
```

---

```c++
// artg4/util/StringIDs.cc  (partial listing)
// Get the ID for a string. If it is not already in the vector, then add it
size_t artg4::StringIDs::idGivenString( const std::string & s ) {

  // Form the hash
  size_t id = hash_fn_(s);

  // Does this hash already exist in the map?
  if ( hashToStringMap_.find(id) != hashToStringMap_.end() ) {

    // Check for hash collision (the hashed string does not equal our string)
    if ( hashToStringMap_[id] != s ) {
      // HASH COLLISION !!
      throw cet::exception("artg4::StringIDs") 
           << "Hash collision detected!";
    }
  }
  else {
   // Add to the map
   hashToStringMap_.emplace(id, s);
  }
  return id;
}
```

# Schema evolution

The change to `StringIDs` is a breaking change. Old files have the wrong internals. 

__We always want to be able to read old files with new releases__


Root has a schema evolution system...

- Old files without new member data will get filled in randomally
- Old files with member data removed by new release will give zero
- Where a member has a type change, the type in the old file will be coereced to the new type if possible
- For big changes, need to write schema evolution code

---

# Schema evolution code

```c++
<!-- classes_def.xml -->
<lcgdict>
    <class name="artg4::StringIDs"   ClassVersion="15">
        <version ClassVersion="15"  checksum="1375741644"/>
        <version ClassVersion="14"  checksum="2137085475"/>
    </class>
    <class name="std::map<size_t, std::string>"/>
    <class name="art::Wrapper<artg4::StringIDs>"/>

    <!-- Schema evolution rules for artg4::StringIDs -->
    <!-- version 14 -> 15 -->
    <ioread
        version="[-14]"
        sourceClass="artg4::StringIDs"
        source="std::vector<std::string> stringVec_"
        targetClass="artg4::StringIDs"
        target="hashToStringMap_"
        include="vector;string;map">
```

---

... continued ...

```c++
  <![CDATA[
           std::cout << "WARNING: Converting StringIDs to new " <<
                        "style but not using hashes " << 
                        "- so will not be mergable" << std::endl;
           for ( unsigned int i = 0; i < onfile.stringVec_.size() ; 
                                                               ++i ) {
             hashToStringMap_[ static_cast<size_t>(i) ] = 
                                             onfile.stringVec_[i];
           }
        ]]>
    </ioread>
```

This schema evolution will make the ID numbers in the old files work with the new code (but will not be hashes). 

---

# Aggregation

A run record is _always_ written when you close a file. What if you store many files with the same run number? What if you load all of those files in the same job and write a __merged__ output?

For the latter, the run records are aggregated. There are rules to do this, but for complicated types you have to write code...

```c++
namespace artg4 {
  class PhysicalVolumeStoreData {
    public:
      void aggregate(PhysicalVolumeStoreData const & other ) {
            for ( auto const& anID : other.ids() ) {
                  idGivenString( other.stringGivenID(anID));
            }
      }
      // Get a vector of ids
      std::vector<size_t> ids() const { return ids_.ids(); }
      
    private:
      StringIDs ids_;
```
---

# Writing bad files

- If you write multiple files with the same Run and subrun numbers...
- the event ranges __MUST NOT__ overlap

--- 

BAD - a job that merges files "A" and "B" will result in file "C" that will be __unreadable__:

|File|Run|Subrun|Event range|
|----|---|------|-----------|
| A  | 1 | 505  |  1-999    |
| B  | 1 | 505  |  1-999    |

---

# Writing bad files - fixes

GOOD: Different event ranges

|File|Run|Subrun|Event range|
|----|---|------|-----------|
| A  | 1 | 505  |  1-999    |
| B  | 1 | 505  |  1000-1999 |

--- 
GOOD: Different subrun numbers

|File|Run|Subrun|Event range|
|----|---|------|-----------|
| A  | 1 | 505  |  1-999    |
| B  | 1 | __506__  |  1-999    |

# Conclusions

See https://lyon-fnal.github.io/physicalVolumeStorePaper/pvs.html for more detailed information. Will eventually go into DocDB and the release itself. 

Code is out for testing (e-mail to select few for now)

Many good tests!
